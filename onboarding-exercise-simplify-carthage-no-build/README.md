# Welcome aboard!

This is the Itty Bitty Apps developer onboarding exercise!

This project is intended to provide a concrete introduction to developing applications here at Itty Bitty Apps.

## Intent of the exercise

- To provide an introduction to Rx (RxSwift on iOS and RxJava on Android) and a [functional reactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming) style of programming.
- To provide an introduction to the way we approach peer code review and pull requests.
- To provide you with feedback on your current coding approaches and how they might differ from what is expected at IBA.
- To provide you with an opportunity to learn and try new things.

The goal is to experiment, learn and ask questions. While you may be familiar with many of these tools and techniques, the exercise is a good opportunity to consolidate your knowledge.

## Guidance

- **Don't** stress if you don't understand something, or get stuck. This isn't a test!
- **Do** ask lots of questions.
- **Do** reach out for help on the IBA slack. Everybody is here to help you and provide support.
- **Do** join the relevant channels in IBA slack such as `#android`, `#kotlin`, `#ios`, `#swift`, `#rx`, and `#engineering`.

## Getting started

- Read this `README`. You're doing this. Excellent!
- Fork this repository in GitHub into your own account and invite your mentor/on-boarding buddy and the IBA Engineering team to be collaborators on your fork of the repository.

## Pre-requisites

- You will need a `git` client. We recommend `git` on the command-line, [Git Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/mac) (IBA will provide a license on request) or [GitUp](https://gitup.co).

Note that on a Mac the `git` command line tool is installed as part of Xcode or the Xcode Command Line Tools. So even as an Android developer you should probably install Xcode.

Once you've forked your own copy of this repository you can change it however you like. However you should follow the guidelines outlined in `CONTRIBUTING.md` when doing so.

If you do not feel that you are familar enough with `git` as a source control tool you should read the [official Git book](https://book.git-scm.com/book/en/v2). GitHub also has a number of [good guides](https://guides.github.com) and the folks who created Git Tower also have a [good book](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook) for beginners.

### iOS developers

- Everything you need is in the `iOS` sub-directory.
- Start by reading the [iOS README](iOS/README.md).

### Android developers

- Everything you need is in the `Android` sub-directory.
- Start by reading the [Android README](Android/README.md).

### Further guidance

If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask a peer or your mentor. Also, asking questions in the `#engineering` channel in the Itty Bitty Apps Slack instance is encouraged!
