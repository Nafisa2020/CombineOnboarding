# iOS on-boarding exercise

Welcome to the Itty Bitty Apps iOS developer onboarding exercise!

## Getting started

- Get latest non-beta Xcode from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?) or [Apple Developer Downloads](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/) site.

## Download and compile dependencies

This project uses Swift Package Manager to manage it's dependencies so everything should be good to go as it is.

Now open the `Onboarding.xcworkspace`!

## Build and run

Once you build and run the application you should be able to see a list of hacker news articles. The articles are from the [Hackernews API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API).
